## Use Cases
I invest in individual stocks in the stock market and have multiple accounts with different brokerages. I wanted a simple way to keep track of my investments in one place. Currently, I could use Mint (which is slow and doesn't show individual stock performance), Personal Capital (which has the same issues as Mint), or check in with each individual brokerage to check the status of my investments. Furthermore, each brokerage had different ways of formatting their data and in general can be intimidating/unfriendly for new users.
